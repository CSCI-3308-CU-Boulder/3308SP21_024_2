# Team PlaySync

Building a cross-platform Playlist Synchronization Toolset

### Description

PlaySync, as proposed, is a software tool to migrate/synchronize playlists across multiple music streaming platforms. These platforms may include but are not limited to, Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, Amazon Music, and YouTube Music. The tool will prompt users to log in to their respective platform accounts and specify which platform they wish to migrate from and which to migrate to. It will then ask the user to specify which playlists they wish to migrate. It will also allow users to view the contents of each playlist before transferring.

Additionally, the software will allow users to sync their playlists across platforms and give them the option to do a one-time sync or have their playlists sync automatically during a given time interval whenever changes to their playlist are made. Users will also be able to share playlists with other users.
